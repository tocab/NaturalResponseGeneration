# NaturalResponseGeneration
Learning to generate responses for questions with deep learning methods

This project does not contain the data files. For learning to generate answers for questions,
the _Yahoo! Answers Comprehensive Questions and Answers version 1.0 (multi part)_
was used. The text data was pre processed and prepared to fit into the neural network.

This is the code-only version, the pre trained weights are not included.
